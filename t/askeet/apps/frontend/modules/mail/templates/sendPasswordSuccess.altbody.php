Dear askeet user,
 
A request for <?php echo $mail->getSubject() ?> was sent to this address.
 
For safety reasons, the askeet website does not store passwords in clear.

You can now connect to your askeet profile with:

To get connected, go to the login page (http://www.askeet.com/login)
and enter these codes.
 
We hope to see you soon on askeet!
